<p>Albert Einstein (1879–1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist best known for developing the theory of relativity, one of the two pillars of modern physics (alongside quantum mechanics). His most famous equation, E = mc², established the relationship between energy and mass and transformed our understanding of the universe.
Einstein’s special relativity (1905) explained how time and space are linked for objects moving at constant speeds, while his general relativity (1915) expanded this to include gravity, showing that massive objects curve spacetime itself. These theories revolutionized science and led to practical technologies like GPS.
He received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921, not for relativity, but for explaining the photoelectric effect, which laid the foundation for quantum theory. Einstein was also a passionate humanitarian and pacifist, speaking out against war and nationalism, and later warning about the dangers of nuclear weapons.
After emigrating to the United States in 1933, he worked at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton until his death. His work continues to influence physics, philosophy, and our broader understanding of reality.</p>
