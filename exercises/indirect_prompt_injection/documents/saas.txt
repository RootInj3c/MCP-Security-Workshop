SaaS Products – Summary

Software as a Service (SaaS) is a software delivery model where applications are hosted in the cloud and accessed over the internet — typically through a web browser — rather than being installed on local devices. Users subscribe to the service, paying monthly or annually, instead of buying perpetual licenses.

SaaS providers manage infrastructure, maintenance, security, and updates, allowing customers to focus on using the software without handling backend operations. This model is highly scalable, cost-effective, and accessible from anywhere.

Common examples include Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Salesforce, Slack, and Zoom.
